"""Metadata: Information on numeric data stored in a structured way.

Metadata are one key concept of the ASpecD framework, and they come in
different flavours. Perhaps the easiest to grasp is metadata that accompany
measurements---and are often stored separately from the data in metadata
files. Other types of metadata are those of processing steps or
representations. This module is only concerned with the first kind of
metadata, information accompanying data and usually recorded at the same
time as the numeric data.

Each :class:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset` contains a
:attr:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset.metadata` attribute that is in turn an object
of class :class:`aspecd.metadata.DatasetMetadata`. This latter object is
composed of different metadata objects each inheriting from
:class:`aspecd.metadata.Metadata`. Upon import of a dataset, the importer
class needs to make sure that as many metadata as possible are read and
imported to the dataset as well.

Generally speaking, metadata can be thought of as key--value stores that
might be hierarchically structured and thus cascaded. Nevertheless, classes
have some advantages over using simple dictionaries, as there are certain
operations that are common to some or all types of metadata.


Metadata classes
================

The classes implemented in this module can be grouped into general metadata
classes, concrete metadata classes, and metadata classes for datasets. Each
will be described shortly below.


General metadata classes
------------------------

The most basic class is :class:`aspecd.metadata.PhysicalQuantity` storing
all relevant information about a physical quantity in an easily accessible
way, eventually allowing to test for commensurable quantities and
converting between units.

Next is :class:`aspecd.metadata.Metadata` as a generic class for all
metadata containers. All other classes storing metadata, particularly those
storing metadata accompanying measurements and therefore ending up in the
metadata of a :class:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset`, should inherit from this class.


Concrete metadata classes
-------------------------

Currently, three classes for actual metadata of experimental datasets and
one class for calculated datasets are contained in the ASpecD framework,
namely :class:`aspecd.metadata.Measurement` for storing
general information about a given measurement,
:class:`aspecd.metadata.Sample` for all information regarding the sample
investigated, and :class:`aspecd.metadata.TemperatureControl` for
information about the temperature control (including whether temperature has
been actively controlled at all during the measurement) for experimental
datasets and :class:`aspecd.metadata.Calculation` for storing details about
the calculation underlying the (numeric) data for calculated datasets.


Metadata classes for datasets
-----------------------------

The attribute `metadata` in the :class:`aspecd.dataset.ExperimentalDataset`
is of type :class:`aspecd.metadata.ExperimentalDatasetMetadata` and
contains the three metadata classes for experimental datasets named above.
Derived packages should extend this class accordingly.

Similarly, the attribute `metadata` in the
:class:`aspecd.dataset.CalculatedDataset` is of type
:class:`aspecd.metadata.CalculatedDatasetMetadata` and contains the respective
metadata class named above. Derived packages should extend this class
accordingly wherever necessary.


Converting metadata from and to dictionaries
============================================

All classes inheriting from :class:`aspecd.metadata.Metadata` provide a
method :meth:`from_dict` allowing to set the attributes of the objects. This
allows for easy use with metadata read from a file into a `dict`.

Similiarly, all classes inheriting from :class:`aspecd.metadata.Metadata` as
well as :class:`aspecd.metadata.PhysicalQuantity` provide a method
:meth:`to_dict` that returns a dictionary of all public attributes of the
respective object. This allows to write metadata to a file.


Mapping metadata read from external sources
===========================================

Generally, the representation and structure of metadata within the dataset
of the ASpecD framework and each application derived from it is separate
from the way the very same metadata are organised in files written mostly
during data acquisition. To map the structure obtained by reading a
metadata file to the internal representation within the dataset, as given
by the :class:`aspecd.metadata.ExperimentalDatasetMetadata` class,
there exists a generic mapper class :class:`aspecd.metadata.MetadataMapper`.
This way, you can separate the representations of metadata and support
mapping for different versions of metadata files.


.. note::

    As mappings can become quite complicated and specifying lists of
    mappings for the :class:`aspecd.metadata.MetadataMapper` by hand can
    become quite tedious, you can specify metadata mapping recipes in YAML
    files in a rather simple syntax. See the documentation of the
    :class:`aspecd.metadata.MetadataMapper` class and its
    :meth:`aspecd.metadata.MetadataMapper.create_mappings` method for details.

    This method and the underlying ideas are heavily based on concepts
    and code developed by J. Popp for use within the `trEPR Python package
    <https://docs.trepr.de/>`_.


Metadata in packages based on the ASpecD framework
==================================================

The dataset as unit of (numerical) data and metadata is a key concept of the
ASpecD framework and a necessary prerequisite for a semantic understanding
within the routines. Every measurement (or calculation) produces (raw) data
that are useless without additional information, such as experimental
parameters. This additional information is termed "metadata" within the
ASpecD framework.

Additionally to combining numerical data and metadata, a dataset provides a
common structure, unifying the different file formats used as source for
both, data and metadata. Hence, the actual data format does not matter,
greatly facilitating dealing with data from different sources (and even
different kinds of data).

Therefore, if you develop a new package based on the ASpecD framework,
one of the first and most important steps is to create a (hierarchical)
metadata structure for your datasets. This requires a thorough understanding
of the spectroscopic method you develop the package for and most probably
several years of practical experience in the lab. Good sources of
inspiration are the vendor file formats usually storing instrument
parameters and alike in some form. If you are lucky, you can actually access
this information. If not, you may need to store these metadata in an
additional external file that gets written manually during data recording.

Some basic metadata that are rarely contained within vendor file formats,
as they concern the actual sample measured, as well as metadata for
calculated datasets can be found in the
:class:`aspecd.metadata.ExperimentalDatasetMetadata` and
:class:`aspecd.metadata.CalculatedDatasetMetadata`.

class PhysicalQuantity(aspecd.utils.ToDictMixin):
    """
    Class for storing all relevant informations about a physical quantity.

    A physical quantity, Q, consists always of a value, {Q} and a
    corresponding unit, [Q], hence:

    Q = {Q} [Q] .

    See, e.g., the "IUPAC Green Book" for further details.

    To get a string representation of a physical quantity, i.e., its value
    and unit separated by a single space, simply use :meth:`str()`.

    To set value (and unit) from a string, either use :meth:`from_string` or
    supply the string as argument while instantiating the object. Make sure
    the value part of the string to be convertible to float. Otherwise,
    a :class:`ValueError` will be raised.

    Attributes
    ----------
    unit : :class:`str`
        symbol of the unit of the corresponding value

        SI units are preferred
    dimension : :class:`str`
        dimension of the corresponding value

        useful for (automatic) conversions
    name : :class:`str`
        name of the physical quantity in a given context

    Parameters
    ----------
    string : :class:`str`
        String containing value and unit, separated by whitespace

        Will be used to set value and unit correspondingly.

        If no second element separated by whitespace is present,
        only :attr:`value` will be set.
    value : `float`
        Numerical value
    unit : :class:`str`
        String containing the unit of the corresponding value.

        SI units are preferred, and their abbreviations should be used.

class MetadataMapper:
    """
    Mapper for metadata.

    Allows to convert a dictionary containing metadata read, e.g., from a
    metadata file to a dictionary that corresponds to the internal
    structure of the metadata in a dataset stored in
    :class:`aspecd.metadata.ExperimentalDatasetMetadata`.

    If all you need is to convert the dictionary keys to proper variable
    names conforming to the naming scheme proposed by `PEP 8
    <https://pep8.org/>`_, you may simply use the method
    :meth:`keys_to_variable_names`.

    Tasks that can be currently performed to map a dictionary to the
    internal structure of the metadata representation in a dataset contain
    renaming of keys via :meth:`rename_key` and combining items via
    :meth:`combine_items` as well as copying keys via :meth:`copy_key` and
    moving items via :meth:`move_item`.

    Rather than performing the mappings by hand, calling these methods
    repeatedly, you may use a mapping table contained in the
    :attr:`mappings` attribute. If you pre-define such mapping tables,
    you can easily apply different mappings depending on the version of
    your original metadata structure. Once you assigned the appropriate
    mapping table to the :attr:`mappings` attribute, simply call
    :meth:`map`. If everything turns out well, this should map your
    metadata contained in :attr:`metadata` according to the mapping table
    contained in :meth:`mappings`. Finally, you may want to assing this
    converted data structure to your dataset's metadata attribute,
    using :meth:`ExperimentalDatasetMetadata.from_dict()`.

    As it is often tedious to manually create the entries of the mapping
    table residing in :attr:`mappings`, you can use mapping recipes stored
    in YAML files together with the :meth:`create_mappings` method. For
    details of the structure of the mapping recipe YAML files, see the
    documentation of the :meth:`create_mappings` method. Note that you need
    to specify the filename for the mapping recipe used in
    :attr:`recipe_filename` as well as the version of the metadata file
    format in :attr:`version` to get this to work. The :meth:`create_mappings`
    method and the underlying ideas are heavily based on concepts and code
    developed by J. Popp for use within the `trEPR Python package
    <https://docs.trepr.de/>`_.

        Map according to mappings in :attr:`mappings`.

        Each mapping is defined as a list containing optionally a key for a
        sub-dictionary as first element, the method to be performed as
        second element, and the parameters for this method as third element.

        An example for a mapping may look like this::

            mapping = [['', 'rename_key', ['old', 'new']]]

        This would rename the key ``old`` in :attr:`metadata` to ``new``.

        To do the same for a key in a "sub-dictionary", you may provide a
        mapping similar to the following::

            mapping = [['test', 'rename_key', ['old', 'new']]]

        This would rename the key ``old`` in the dictionary ``test`` in
        :attr:`metadata` to ``new``. The same pattern optionally specifying
        a dictionary to operate on can be applied to all the other mappings
        detailed below.

        Similarly, you can join two items to a new item. In this case,
        a mapping may look like this::

            mapping = [['', 'combine_items', [['key1', 'key2'], 'new']]]

        This would join the values corresponding to the two keys ``key1`` and
        ``key2`` and assign them to the new key ``new``. If you would like
        to join the values with a particular string, this can be done as well::

            mapping = [['', 'combine_items', [['key1', 'key2'], 'new', ' ']]]

        Here, the two values will be joined using a space.

        Sometimes you want to combine keys, but need one of the two keys
        several times. Hence, you would like to *first* copy this key to
        another one. This can be done in the following way::

            mapping = [['', 'copy_key', ['old', 'new']]]

        And finally, there are cases where you want to move an item from
        one dictionary to another. This can be done using the following
        mapping::

            mapping = [['', 'move_item', ['key', 'source', 'target']]]

        Here, "source" and "target" are the names of the respective
        dictionaries the item should be moved between. If the target
        dictionary does not exist, by default, the method will raise an
        exception. If, however, you decide to exactly know what you do,
        you can pass an additional parameter explicitly telling the method
        to create the target dictionary::

            mapping = [['', 'move_item', ['key', 'source', 'target', True]]]

        In this particular case, however, you are solely responsible for
        any typos when specifying the name of the target dictionary,
        as this will most probably mess up your dictionaries and result in
        hard to track bugs.

        Create mappings from mapping recipe stored in YAML file.

        Mapping recipes are stored in an external file (currently a YAML
        file whose filename is stored in :attr:`recipe_filename`) in their
        own format described hereafter. From this file, the recipes are read
        and converted into mappings in the :attr:`mappings` attribute.

        Based on the version number of the format the metadata from an external
        source are stored in, the correct recipe is selected.

        Following is an example of a YAML file containing recipes. Each map can
        contain several types of mappings and the latter can contain several
        entries:

        Unknown mappings are silently ignored. The difference between the
        two entries in ``move item`` is that in the latter case, the target
        dictionary will be created. Be careful with this option, as typos
        introduced in your mapping recipe will lead to hard-to-debug
        behaviour of your application. See :meth:`move_item` for details.

        Generally, the YAML file should be pretty self-explanatory. For
        details of the different mappings, see the documentation of the
        respective methods of the class, namely :meth:`combine_items`,
        :meth:`rename_key`, :meth:`copy_key`, and :meth:`move_item`.

        .. important::

            The sequence of operations can sometimes be crucial. They are
            called as follows: "copy key" -> "combine items" -> "rename key"
            -> "remove items"

        Note that you can name the mappings called here ``map 1`` and ``map 2``
        as you like. Use descriptive names wherever possible.

        A hint on the filenames for metadata recipe YAML files: Use
        descriptive names containing the format of the metadata files. For
        info files, something like ``infofile_metadata_mappings.yaml`` may
        be reasonable.
