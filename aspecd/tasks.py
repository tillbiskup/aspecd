One main aspect of tasks is to provide the constituents of a
:ref:`recipe-driven data analysis <recipes>`, i.e.
:class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe` and :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef`. In its
simplest form, a recipe gets cooked by a chef, resulting in a series of
tasks being performed on a list of datasets.

The idea of recipes here is to provide all necessary information for data
processing and analysis in a simple, human-readable and human-writable form.
This allows users not familiar with programming to perform even complex
tasks. In addition, recipes can even be "executed" using the command line,
not needing to start a Python interpreter.

From a user's perspective, a recipe is usually stored in a `YAML
<https://yaml.org/>`_ file. This allows to easily create and modify recipes
without knowing too much about the underlying processes. For an accessible
overview of the YAML syntax, see the `introduction provided by ansible
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html>`_ .


Recipe-driven data analysis by example
======================================

Recipes always consist of two major parts: A list of datasets to operate
on, and a list of tasks to be performed on the datasets. Of course, you can
specify for each task on which datasets it should be performed, and if
possible, whether it should be performed on each dataset separately or
combined. The latter is particularly interesting for representations (e.g.,
plots) consisting of multiple datasets, or analysis steps spanning multiple
datasets.


A first recipe
--------------

To give a first impression of how such a recipe may look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    format:
      type: ASpecD recipe
      version: '0.2'

    datasets:
      - loi:xxx
      - loi:yyy

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep
        properties:
          parameters:
            param1: bar
            param2: foo
          prop2: blub
      - kind: singleanalysis
        type: SingleAnalysisStep
        properties:
          parameters:
            param1: bar
            param2: foo
          prop2: blub
        apply_to:
          - loi:xxx
        result: new_dataset

Here, ``tasks`` is a list of dictionary-style entries. The key ``kind``
determines which kind of task should be performed. For each kind, a class
subclassing :class:`aspecd.tasks.Task` needs to exist. For details,
see below. The key ``type`` stores the name of the actual class, such as a
concrete processing step derived from
:class:`aspecd.processing.SingleProcessingStep`. The dictionary ``properties``
contains keys corresponding to the attributes of the respective class.
Depending on the type of task, additional keys can be used, such as
``apply_to`` to determine the datasets this task should be applied to,
or ``result`` providing a label for a dataset created newly by an analysis
task.


.. note::
    The use of ``loi:`` markers in the example above points to a situation
    in which every dataset can be accessed by a unique identifier. For
    details, see the `LabInform documentation <https://www.labinform.de/>`_.


Base directory for dataset import
---------------------------------

There are different ways to refer to datasets, but the most common (for now)
is to specify the (relative or absolute) path to the datasets within the
local file system.

At the same time, the "paths" listed in the ``datasets`` list are used as
internal references within the recipe. Therefore, short names are preferrable.

To make things a bit easier, there is a way to define the source directory
for datasets:

.. code-block:: yaml

    directories:
      datasets_source: /path/to/my/datasets/

    datasets:
      - dataset1
      - dataset2

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep


In this case, all dataset names will be treated relative to the source
directory. Note that if you provide the option
``datasets_source_directory``, this can be both, an absolute path, as shown
here for unixoid file systems, and a relative path, as shown in the second
example below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    directories:
      datasets_source: relative/path/to/my/datasets/

    datasets:
      - dataset1
      - dataset2

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep

Here, paths have been given for unixoid file systems, using ``/`` as a
separator. Adjust to your needs if necessary.


Output directory
----------------

Some tasks, namely plotting and report tasks, can save their results to
files. This will usually be the directory you cook the recipe from. However,
sometimes it is quite convenient to specify an output directory, either
relative or absolute.

To do so, simply add the ``output`` key to the top level ``directories`` key of
your recipe:

.. code-block:: yaml

    directories:
      output: /absolute/path/for/the/outputs

    datasets:
      - dataset

    tasks:
      - kind: singleplot
        type: SinglePlotter
        properties:
          filename:
            - fancyfigure.pdf

As said, this path can as well be a relative path with respect to the
directory you cook your recipes from:

.. code-block:: yaml

    directories:
      output: relative/path/for/the/outputs

    datasets:
        - dataset

    tasks:
      - kind: singleplot
        type: SinglePlotter
        properties:
          filename:
            - fancyfigure.pdf

Here, paths have been given for unixoid file systems, using ``/`` as a
separator. Adjust to your needs if necessary.


Tasks from other packages
-------------------------

Usually, you will use classes to perform the individual tasks that come
from your own package. There is a a simple way of doing that, not having to
prefix the kind property of every single task: define the default package
name like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    settings:
      default_package: my_package

    datasets:
      - loi:xxx
      - loi:yyy

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep


If you would like to use a class from a different package for only one task,
feel free to prefix the "kind" attribute of the respective task, as shown:

.. code-block:: yaml

    tasks:
      - kind: some_other_package.processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep


Of course, in order to work, this package termed here "some_other_package"
needs to follow the same basic rules and layout as the ASpecD framework and
packages derived from it. In particular, if you use the "default_package"
directive in your recipe, the given package needs to implement a child of
the :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` class.

To state the obvious: You can, of course, combine both strategies, defining
a default package and overriding this for a particular task:

.. code-block:: yaml

    settings:
      default_package: my_package

    datasets:
      - loi:xxx
      - loi:yyy

    tasks:
      - kind: some_other_package.processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep


There is one important exception from this rule: If you have defined a
default package, and for the type defined in a task there exists no
corresponding class in the default package, the class will be looked up in
the ASpecD framework. This means as well that if you define a class with the
identical name to a class in the ASpecD framework in a derived package,
and you want to explicitly use the "original" class from the ASpecD package,
you need to explicitly prefix the value of the ``kind`` key of your respective
task with "aspecd.".


Setting own labels (and properties) for datasets
------------------------------------------------

Usually, you specify the path (or any other unique and supported identifier) to
your dataset(s) in the list of datasets at the beginning of a recipe, like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
      - /lengthly/path/to/dataset2


In this case, you will have to refer to the datasets by their path (or
whatever other identifier you used). Usually, these identifiers are quite
lengthly, hence not necessarily convenient for use as labels within a
recipe. However, you can set your own ids for datasets:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
        id: dataset1
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset2
        id: dataset2


Make sure to set the ``source`` value to the identifier of your dataset. For
your id, you are free to choose, as long as it is a valid key for a
:class:`dict`. From now on, refer to the datasets by their respective ids
throughout the recipe.

.. note::

    If you use the ``source`` key but don't specify a ``id`` key as well,
    the source will be used as id, as before.


However, you can even drive the whole thing one step further: Suppose you
are bored from having always the dataset label (that is by default identical
to the source it is imported from) appearing in a figure legend, as it simply
does not fit to what you need. How about that:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
        id: dataset1
        label: low concentration
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset2
        id: dataset2
        label: high concentration


In this case, you assign the ``label`` field of your datasets upon loading
them. The idea behind: When specifying which dataset to load, you usually
know best about such things, and you don't want to need to deal with this
later on when plotting.

.. important::

    Generally, each property of a dataset can be set this way. However,
    be careful not to override properties that are not scalar and cannot
    easily be represented in YAML in the recipe, as you will most certainly
    break things otherwise. A good example of how to definitely break
    things would be to override the ``data`` property of a dataset.


Import datasets from other packages
-----------------------------------

Sounds strange in the first place, but appears to be more common than you
may imagine: Sometimes, you need to compare datasets recorded using
different methods that are in turn handled by different ASpecD-derived
packages.

So how to import a dataset using the importer of a different package than
the current one? The syntax for the recipe is much the same as the one
described above for setting other properties of a dataset:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset2
        package: other_package


In this example, the first dataset will be imported using the default
package set for the recipe, but the second dataset will be loaded using the
:class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` and
:class:`aspecd.io.DatasetImporterFactory` classes from ``other_package``. Of
course, you need to make sure that ``other_package`` exists and contains
both, a dataset factory and dataset importer factory. Furthermore, these two
classes need to reside in the same modules as in the ASpecD framework,
*i.e.*, the dataset factory needs to reside in the "dataset" module and the
dataset importer factory in the "io" module.


Specify importer for datasets
-----------------------------

Sometimes it may be necessary to explicitly provide the importer class that
shall be used to import a dataset. In this case, you can explicitly say
which importer to use:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset2
        importer: TxtImporter

However, be careful to match data format and importer, as you are overriding
the automatic importer determination of the
:class:`aspecd.io.DatasetImporterFactory` this way. Furthermore, make sure
the respective importer class exists. Of course, this works as
well with providing an alternative package:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset2
        package: other_package
        importer: TxtImporter

In this particular example, the importer located in
``other_package.io.TxtImporter`` would be used to import your dataset. The
parameters will be directly passed to the importer without further checking,
and it is the sole responsibility of the importer class to make sense of the
parameters provided. Have a look at the documentation of the actual importer
class you intend to use for parameters you can set (if any). Note that many
parameters will not recognise additional parameters.


Specify importer parameters for datasets
----------------------------------------

Furthermore, sometimes you may want to provide parameters for an importer,
*e.g.* in case of importing text files with headers, and you can do this as
well:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset1
      - source: /lengthly/path/to/dataset2
        importer: TxtImporter
        importer_parameters:
          skiprows: 3

You can even provide ``importer_parameters`` without explicitly specifying
an importer to use, although this may lead to hard to detect behaviour,
as you rely on the automatism of choosing the importer class implemented in
the :class:`aspecd.io.DatasetImporterFactory` in this case.


Referring to other datasets and results
---------------------------------------

Some tasks yield results you usually would want to use later on in the
recipe. Prime examples are analysis steps and plots. While analysis steps
have a property ``result`` that can refer to either a dataset or something
else, depending on the actual type of analysis step, plots have a ``label``
that can be used to refer to them.

While analysis steps always yield results, processing steps usually operate
on a dataset that gets modified in turn. However, sometimes it is desired to
return the modified dataset as a *new dataset*, independent of the original
one. In this case, specify a ``result`` here, too. For details, see the
:class:`aspecd.tasks.ProcessingTask` documentation below.


Variable replacement
--------------------

Additionally to the labels described above, variables will be parsed and
replaced. Currently, the following types of variables are understood:

.. code-block:: yaml

    key1: {{ basename(id) }}
    key2: {{ path(id) }}
    key3: {{ id(id) }}

Here, ``id`` is the id used internally for referring to a dataset,
``{{ basename(id) }}`` will be replaced with the file basename of the
respective dataset source, ``{{ path(id) }}`` will be replaced by the path
of the respective dataset source, and  ``{{ id(id) }}`` will be replaced by
the id itself.

Note: The spaces within the double curly brackets are only for better
readability, they can be omitted, although this is not recommended.

Why is this interesting? Suppose you would like to create a rather generic
recipe always performing the same tasks, but for different datasets. A
rather minimal example is given below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - source: /path/to/my_dataset.txt
        id: first_measurement

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: SubtractBaseline
        properties:
          parameters:
            kind: polynomial
            order: 0
      - kind: singleplot
        type: SinglePlotter
        properties:
          filename:
            - {{ basename(first_measurement) }}.pdf

Here, you can see that all you would need to do is to replace the ``source``
with the actual path to your dataset. This will automatically perform the
tasks of the recipe on the given dataset, storing the plot to a
file named ``my_dataset.pdf``.


Executing recipes: serving the cooked results
=============================================

As stated above, a recipe gets cooked by a chef, resulting in a series of
tasks being performed on a list of datasets. However, as an (end) user you
usually don't care about chefs and recipes besides the human-readable and
writable representation of a recipe in YAML format. Therefore, there is a
fairly simple way to get a recipe executed, or, in terms of the metaphor of
recipe and cook, to get the meal served:

.. code-block:: bash

    serve <my-recipe>.yaml

No need of running a Python terminal, no need of instantiating any class.
Simply executing a command from a terminal, that's all that is to it. In
this particular example, ``<my-recipe>`` is a placeholder for your recipe
file name.

Of course, you need to have the ASpecD package installed (preferrably within
a virtual environment), and you still need to have access to a terminal. But
that's all. And when you have hit "enter", you will usually see a list of
lines starting with "INFO" telling you what is happening. If something is
notable or gets entirely wrong, you will see lines starting with "WARNING"
or "ERROR", respectively. With standard settings, the latter will *not*
provide you with the complete stack trace, as this is usually not helpful
for the user. If, however, you are developer or otherwise interested in the
details (or are asked by a developer to provide more details), use the
``-v`` switch to get more verbose output. Conversely, if you insist on not
seeing any info of what happened, you can use the ``-q`` switch to silence
the ``serve`` command. To get more information, use the help builtin to the
``serve`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    serve -h

Its output will look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: none

    usage: serve [-h] [-v | -q] recipe

    Process a recipe in context of recipe-driven data analysis

    positional arguments:
      recipe         YAML file containing recipe

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose  show debug output
      -q, --quiet    don't show any output


Of course, you can do the same from within Python (however, why would you
want to do that)::

    serve(recipe_filename='<my-recipe>.yaml')

And if you insist, of course there is an object-oriented way to do it::

    chef_de_service = ChefDeService()
    chef_de_service.serve(recipe_filename='<my-recipe>.yaml')

The good news with all this: It should work for every package derived from
the ASpecD framework, as long as you specify the ``default_package``
directive within the recipe. And of course, calling the recipe from the
command-line will only help you if it creates some kind of output.


History of a recipe
===================

The :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef` class takes care of automatically creating a
history of the recipe cooked, with a full list of parameters for each task.
This history is a dict that follows the same structure as the original
recipe. Therefore, you can save this history to a YAML file and use it as a
recipe again, perhaps after some modifications.

If you use the :class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService` class, you need not care
about actually writing the history to a YAML file. Therefore, using this
class or even the command-line call to ``serve`` as described above,
is highly recommended. In this case, you will have a full history of all
your tasks contained in a human-readable YAML file, together with some
additional information on the system and package versions used to cook the
recipe, as well as the time for start and end of cooking.

To make it short: The history of the recipe allows you to perform a fully
reproducible data analysis even of multiple datasets and arbitrarily
complex tasks without having to care about the details. You get it all for
free. That's what the ASpecD framework is all about. Care about the results
of your data analysis and what this means in terms of answering the
scientific questions that originally triggered obtaining and analysing the
data. Reproducibility is been taken care of for you.


Suppress automatically writing history
--------------------------------------

.. warning::

    Not having a history of each individual step of your data analysis is
    considered bad practice and not consistent with reproducible research.
    Therefore, use the following only in debugging/development settings,
    never in real life applications.

In some particular cases, namely debugging and development, writing a
history for each individual cooking of a recipe might be inconvenient.
Therefore, you can tell ASpecD not to automatically write a history.
However, *use with extreme caution*!

.. code-block:: yaml

    settings:
        write_history: false

To remind you of what you are doing, this will issue a warning on the
command line if using ``serve``.


Kinds of tasks
==============

.. sidebar:: Kind and type

    The "kind" of a task usually refers to the module the class belongs to,
    the "type" is the actual class name.


Tasks can be grouped similarly to the way classes of the ASpecD framework
are grouped into different modules. Hence, there are different *kinds* of
tasks. Each task is internally represented by an :obj:`aspecd.tasks.Task`
object, more precisely an object instantiated from a subclass of
:class:`aspecd.tasks.Task`. This polymorphism of task classes makes it
possible to easily extend the scope of recipe-driven data analysis.
Therefore, to allow ASpecD to know how to handle your task (*i.e.*,
what task object to create), you need to specify the *kind* of your task
within the recipe, besides the *type* that is the class name of the actual
class performing the respective task.

Currently, the following subclasses are implemented:

  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.ProcessingTask`

     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleprocessingTask`
       (alias of :class:`aspecd.tasks.ProcessingTask`)
     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultiprocessingTask`

  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.AnalysisTask`

     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleanalysisTask`
     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultianalysisTask`

  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.AnnotationTask`
  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.PlotTask`

     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleplotTask`
     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultiplotTask`
     * :class:`aspecd.tasks.CompositeplotTask`

  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.TabulateTask`
  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.ReportTask`

    * :class:`aspecd.tasks.FigurereportTask`

  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.ModelTask`
  * :class:`aspecd.tasks.ExportTask`

As you can see from the above list, there are (currently) three special cases
of kinds of tasks: processing, analysis and plot tasks. Usually, you will
set the ``kind`` of a task in a recipe to the module the class eventually
performing the task resides in. As both, analyses and plots can either span
one or several datasets, here we have to discriminate. Therefore,
it is *essential* that you take care to set the ``kind`` value in your
recipe for these kinds of tasks to ``singleanalysis`` or ``multianalysis``,
respectively. the same is true for plots. To make this a bit easier to
follow, see the example below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep

      - kind: singleanalysis
        type: AnalysisStep

      - kind: multiplot
        type: MultiPlotter1D


.. important::
    As long as there is no automatic syntax checking of recipes before they
    get executed, you are entirely responsible on your own to provide
    correct syntax. From own experience, there are a few problems frequently
    arising: Don't use **analysis**, but either **singleanalysis** or
    **multianalysis** as kind in an analysis step. The same applies to
    plots. Don't use **plotting**, but either **singleplot** or
    **multiplot** as kind.


Properties of tasks
===================

For each task, you can set all attributes of the underlying class using the
``properties`` dictionary in the recipe. Therefore, to know which
parameters can be set for what kind of task means simply to check the
documentation for the respective classes. I.e., for a task represented by
an :obj:`aspecd.tasks.ProcessingTask` object, check out the appropriate
class from the :mod:`aspecd.processing` module. The same is true for
packages derived from ASpecD.

A simple example is the normalisation processing step using the
:class:`aspecd.processing.Normalisation` class:

.. code-block:: yaml

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: Normalisation
        properties:
          parameters:
            kind: amplitude

How to know what properties can be set? Have a look at the
:class:`aspecd.processing.Normalisation` documentation. Note that all
properties that are documented there can be set using a recipe. As
processing steps always have a property ``parameters`` that is a
:class:`dict`, you need to set the individual keys of this dictionary.

Additionally, for each task, you can explicitly state to which of the
datasets it should be applied to. Note that not only the datasets initially
loaded can be used here, but all labels referring to datasets that originate
from other tasks.

Furthermore, depending on the kind of task, you may be able to set
additional parameters controlling in more detail how the particular task is
performed. For details, see the documentation of the respective task
subclass in this module below.


Prerequisites for recipe-driven data analysis
=============================================

.. note::

    This section is mostly relevant for those developing packages based on
    the ASpecD framework. Users of recipe-driven data analysis usually need
    not bother about these details (as others did for them already).


To be able to use recipe-driven data analysis in packages derived from the
ASpecD framework, a series of prerequisites needs to be met, *i.e.*, classes
implemented. Besides the usual suspects such as
:class:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset` and its constituents as well as the
different processing and analysis steps based on
:class:`aspecd.processing.SingleProcessingStep` and
:class:`aspecd.analysis.SingleAnalysisStep`, two different factory
classes need to be implemented in particular, subclassing

  * :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` and
  * :class:`aspecd.io.DatasetImporterFactory`,

respectively. Actually, only :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` is
directly used by :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`, however, internally it relies
on the existence of :class:`aspecd.io.DatasetImporterFactory` to return a
dataset based solely on a (unique) ID.

Besides implementing these classes, the facilities provided by the
:mod:`aspecd.tasks` module should be fully sufficient for regular
recipe-driven data analysis. In particular, normally there should be no need
to subclass any of the classes within this module in a package derived from
the ASpecD framework. One particular design goal of recipe-driven data
analysis is to decouple the actual tasks being performed from the
general handling of recipes. The former is implemented within each
respective package built upon the ASpecD framework, the latter is taken care
of fully by the ASpecD framework itself. You might want to implement a simple
proxy within a derived package to prevent the user from having to call out to
functionality provided directly by the ASpecD framework. The latter might be
confusing for those unfamiliar with the underlying details, *i.e.*,
most common users. More explicit, you may want to create proxy classes in
the processing and analysis modules of your package, subclassing all the
concrete processing and analysis steps already provided with the ASpecD
framework.


Notes for developers
====================

.. note::

    This section is only relevant for those further developing the ASpecD
    framework. Users of recipe-driven data analysis as well as developers of
    packages derived from the ASpecD framework usually need not bother about
    these details (as others did for them already).

Recipe-driven data analysis introduces another level of abstraction and
indirection with its use of recipes in YAML format. Based on this analogy,
we have a :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe` consisting of a list of datasets and a
list of :class:`aspecd.tasks.Task` to be performed on the datasets. Such recipe
gets "cooked" by a :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef`, and for the convenience of
the user of recipe-driven data analysis, the result gets "served" by the
:class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService`. An actual user will not see any of
this, but simply call ``serve <recipe-name.yaml>`` from the command line.

Internally, recipes are represented by an instance of
:class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`, and this representation takes care already to
import the datasets specified in the ``datasets`` block of a recipe.
Therefore, all handling of data import needs to be done here. Similarly,
upon populating a recipe (from dict or by importing), the tasks will already
be created using a :class:`aspecd.tasks.TaskFactory`.

The actual tasks are represented by instances of
subclasses of :class:`aspecd.tasks.Task`, and they in turn create an
instance of the actual object internally, applying this to the dataset(s).

"Cooking" a recipe is done by :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef`, and this class
takes care of writing a history in form of an executable recipe, thus ensuring
reproducibility and good scientific practice.

"Serving" the results of a cooked recipe is eventually the responsibility of
the :class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService`, and it is this class calling out to
the :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef` and writing the history to an actual file
that can be used as recipe again. For the convenience of the user, an entry
point (console script) is included in the ``setup.py`` file calling
:func:`aspecd.tasks.serve` that in turn takes care of loading the recipe and
instantiating a :class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService`.

====================


.. todo::
    There is a number of things that are not yet implemented, but highly
    recommended for a working recipe-driven data analysis that follows good
    practice for reproducible research. This includes (but may not be
    limited to):

      * Parser for recipes performing a static analysis of their syntax.
        Useful particularly for larger datasets and/or longer lists of tasks.

class Recipe:
    """
    Recipes get cooked by chefs in recipe-driven data analysis.

    A recipe contains a list of tasks to be performed on a list of
    datasets. To actually carry out all tasks in a recipe, it is handed
    over to a :obj:`aspecd.tasks.Chef` object for cooking using the
    respective :meth:`aspecd.tasks.Chef.cook` method.

    From a user's perspective, recipes reside usually in YAML files from
    where they are imported into an :obj:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe` object using
    its respective :meth:`import_into` method and an object of class
    :class:`aspecd.io.RecipeYamlImporter`. Similarly, a given recipe can be
    exported back to a YAML file using the :meth:`export_to` method and an
    object of class :class:`aspecd.io.RecipeYamlExporter`.

    In contrast to the persistent form of a recipe (e.g., as file on the
    file system), the object contains actual datasets and tasks that are
    objects of the respective classes. Therefore, the attributes of a
    recipe are normally set by the respective methods from either a file or
    a dictionary (that in turn will normally be created from contents of a
    file).

    Retrieving datasets is delegated to an
    :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` instance stored in
    :attr:`dataset_factory`. This provides a maximum of flexibility but
    makes it necessary to specify (and first implement) such factory in
    packages derived from the ASpecD framework.

    .. todo::
        Can recipes have LOIs themselves and therefore be retrieved from
        the extended data safe? Might be a sensible option, although
        generic (and at the same time unique) LOIs for recipes are much
        harder to create than LOIs for datasets and alike.

        Generally, the concept of a LOI is nothing a recipe needs to know
        about. But it does know about an ID of any kind. Whether this ID
        is a (local) path or a LOI doesn't matter. Somewhere in the ASpecD
        framework there may exist a resolver (factory) for handling IDs of
        any kind and eventually retrieving the respective information.


    Attributes
    ----------
    datasets : :class:`collections.OrderedDict`
        Ordered dictionary of datasets the tasks should be performed for

        Each dataset is an object of class :class:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset`.

        The keys are the dataset ids.

    tasks : :class:`list`
        List of tasks to be performed on the datasets

        Each task is an object of class :class:`aspecd.tasks.Task`.

    results : :class:`collections.OrderedDict`
        Ordered dictionary of results originating from analysis tasks

        Results can be of any type, but are mostly either instances of
        :class:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset` or
        :class:`aspecd.metadata.PhysicalQuantity`.

        The keys are those defined by
        :attr:`aspecd.tasks.SingleanalysisTask.result` and
        :attr:`aspecd.tasks.MultianalysisTask.result`, respectively.

    figures : :class:`collections.OrderedDict`
        Ordered dictionary of figures originating from plotting tasks

        Each entry is an object of class :class:`aspecd.tasks.FigureRecord`.

    plotters : :class:`collections.OrderedDict`
        Ordered dictionary of plotters originating from plotting tasks

        Each entry is an object of class :class:`aspecd.plotting.Plotter`.

        To end up in the list of plotters, the plot task needs to define a
        result. This is mainly used for tasks involving CompositePlotters,
        to define the plotters for each individual plot panel.

    dataset_factory : :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory`
        Factory for datasets used to retrieve datasets

        If no factory is set, but a recipe imported from a file or set from
        a dictionary, an exception will be raised.

    task_factory : :class:`aspecd.tasks.TaskFactory`
        Factory for tasks

        Defaults to an object of class :class:`aspecd.tasks.TaskFactory`.

        If no factory is set, but a recipe imported from a file or set from
        a dictionary, an exception will be raised.

    format : :class:`dict`
        Information on the format of the recipe

        This information is used to automatically convert recipes to the
        current format.

        Dictionary with the following fields:

        type : :class:`str`
            Information on the type of file

            Shall never be changed.

            Default: ASpecD recipe

        version : :class:`str`
            Version of the recipe structure (in form X.Y)

            This information is used to automatically convert recipes to the
            current format.

            Defaults to the latest version.

        .. versionadded:: 0.4

    settings : :class:`dict`
        General settings relevant for cooking the recipe.

        Dictionary with the following fields:

        default_package: :class:`str`
           Name of the package the task objects are obtained from

           If no name for a default package is supplied, "aspecd" is used.

        autosave_plots: :class:`bool`
            Whether to save plots automatically even if no filename is provided.

            If true, each :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleplotTask` and
            :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultiplotTask` will save the plots to default
            file names. For details, see the documentation of the respective
            classes.

            Default: True

           .. versionadded:: 0.2

        write_history: :class:`bool`
           Whether to write a history when serving the recipe.

           If true, for each serving of a recipe, a history will be written
           into a file with same base name and timestamp appended. In terms
           of reproducible research, it is *highly recommended* to always
           write a history. However, when debugging, you may set this to
           "False".

           Default: True

           .. versionadded:: 0.4

        .. versionchanged:: 0.4
            Moved properties to keys in this dictionary

    directories : :class:`dict`
        Optional control of different directories.

        Dictionary with the following fields:

        datasets_source: :class:`str`
            Root directory for the datasets.

            Interpreted as absolute path if starting with the
            system-specific file separator. Otherwise, interpreted as
            relative to the current directory. If provided, all output
            resulting from cooking a recipe will be saved to this path.

        output: :class:`str`
            Directory to save output (plots, reports, ...) to.

            Interpreted as absolute path if starting with the
            system-specific file separator. Otherwise, interpreted as
            relative to the current directory. If provided, all output
            resulting from cooking a recipe will be saved to this path.

            Make sure the path actually exists. Otherwise, you may run into
            trouble when tasks try to save their output.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.4
            Moved properties to keys in this dictionary

    filename : :class:`str`
        Name of the (YAML) file the recipe was loaded from.

        Empty string if recipe was loaded from a dictionary instead.

        The filename can be used to persist the history of a cooked recipe
        in form of a YAML file for full reproducibility. This will be done
        when using the :class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService` class and its
        :meth:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService.serve` method.

        Create YAML representation of recipe.

        As users will interact with recipes primarily in form of YAML files,

        Parameters
        ----------
        remove_empty : :class:`bool`
            Whether to remove empty fields from tasks

            Default: False

        Returns
        -------
        yaml : :class:`str`
            YAML representation of a recipe


        Examples
        --------
        To get the YAML representation of an empty recipe, create a recipe
        object and call this method:

        .. code-block::

            recipe = aspecd.tasks.Recipe()
            print(recipe.to_yaml())

        The result of the last line (the print statement from above) will
        look as follows:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            format:
              type: ASpecD recipe
              version: '0.2'

              write_history: true

              datasets_source: ''
            datasets: []
            tasks: []

        As you can see, you will get the full set of settings currently
        allowed within a recipe. Not all of them are strictly necessary,
        and for details, you still need to look into the documentation.
        But this can make it much easier to start with writing recipes.

        Similarly, you can get YAML representations of tasks that you can
        add to your recipe. For details, see the documentation of the

class Chef:
    """
    Chefs cook recipes in recipe-driven data analysis.

    As a result, they create a full history of the tasks performed,
    including all parameters, implicit and explicit. In this respect,
    they make the history independent of a singe dataset and allow to trace
    processing and analysis of multiple datasets.

    .. note::

        One necessary prerequisite for full reproducibility is therefore
        some kind of persistent and unique identifier for each dataset. The
        "Lab Object Identifier" (LOI) as used within the `LabInform
        <https://www.labinform.de/>`_ framework, is one solution of such
        identifier.


    For persisting the history of cooking a recipe, the contents of the
    ``history`` attribute should be saved as a YAML file. There are two ways
    how to do that: manually and fully automated. If you manually
    instantiate an object of the :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef` class, you would
    need to do that on your own, as follows::

        chef = aspecd.tasks.Chef()
        # ... obtaining recipe from file
        chef.cook(recipe)

        yaml = aspecd.utils.Yaml()
        yaml.dict = chef.history
        yaml.write_to(filename='<my-recipe-history>.yaml')

    The other way is to use an instance of the
    :class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService` class and its
    :meth:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService.serve` method::

        chef_de_service = ChefDeService()
        chef_de_service.serve(recipe_filename='my_recipe.yaml')

    This will automatically save the recipe history for you as a YAML file
    with its filename derived from the original recipe name. For details,
    see the documentation of the :class:`aspecd.tasks.ChefDeService` class.

    The YAML files generated from saving the history should work as recipes
    themselves, therefore allowing a full turnover, as well as easy
    modification of a recipe.

    Attributes
    ----------
    recipe : :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`
        Recipe to cook, i.e. to carry out

    history : :class:`collections.OrderedDict`
        History of cooking the recipe

        Contains a complete record of each task performed, including all
        parameters, implicit and explicit. Additionally, contains system
        information as collected by the :class:`aspecd.system.SystemInfo`
        class.

        Can be exported to a YAML file that works as a recipe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    recipe : :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`
        Recipe to cook, i.e. to carry out

class Task(aspecd.utils.ToDictMixin):
    """
    Base class storing information for a single task.

    Different underlying objects used to actually perform the respective
    task have different requirements and different signatures. In order to
    generically perform a task, for each kind of task -- such as
    processing, analysis, plotting -- this class needs to be subclassed.
    For a number of basic tasks available in the ASpecD package, this has
    already been done. See:

        * :class:`aspecd.tasks.ProcessingTask`
        * :class:`aspecd.tasks.AnalysisTask`

           * :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleanalysisTask`
           * :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultianalysisTask`

        * :class:`aspecd.tasks.AnnotationTask`
        * :class:`aspecd.tasks.PlotTask`

           * :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleplotTask`
           * :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultiplotTask`

        * :class:`aspecd.tasks.ReportTask`

    Note that imports of datasets are usually not handled using tasks,
    as this is taken care of automatically by defining a list of datasets
    in a :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`.

    Usually, you need not care to instantiate objects of the correct type,
    as this is done automatically by the :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe` using
    the :class:`aspecd.tasks.TaskFactory`.


    Attributes
    ----------
    kind : :class:`str`
        Kind of task.

        Usually corresponds to the module name the type (class) is defined in.
        See the note below for special cases.

    type : :class:`str`
        Type of task.

        Corresponds to the class name eventually responsible for performing
        the task.

    package : :class:`str`
        Name of the package the class eventually responsible for performing the
        task belongs to.

    properties : :class:`dict`
        Properties necessary to perform the task.

        Should have keys corresponding to the properties of the class given
        as :attr:`type` attribute.

        Generally, all keys in :attr:`aspecd.tasks.Task.properties` will be
        mapped to the underlying object created to perform the actual task.

        In contrast, all additional attributes of a given task object
        subclassing :class:`aspecd.tasks.Task` that are specific to the task
        object as such and its operation, but not for the object created by
        the task object to perform the task, are not part of the
        :attr:`aspecd.tasks.Task.properties` dict. For a recipe, this means
        that these additional attributes are at the same level as
        :attr:`aspecd.tasks.Task.properties`.

    apply_to : :class:`list`
        List of datasets the task should be applied to.

        Defaults to an empty list, meaning that the task will be performed
        for all datasets contained in a :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`.

        Each dataset is referred to by the value of its
        :attr:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset.source` attribute. This should be
        unique and can consist of a filename, path, URL/URI, LOI, or alike.

    recipe : :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe`
        Recipe containing the task and the list of datasets the task refers to

    comment : :class:`str`
        User-supplied comment describing intent, purpose, reason, ...


    .. note::
        A note to developers: Usually, the :attr:`aspecd.tasks.Task.kind`
        attribute is identical to the module name the respective class
        resides in. However, sometimes this is not the case, as with the
        plotters. In this case, an additional, non-public attribute
        :attr:`aspecd.tasks.Task._module` can be set in classes derived from
        :class:`aspecd.tasks.Task`.

        Examples
        --------
        To get the YAML representation of a concrete task, you need to
        create a task object of the appropriate class and assign a type to it:

        The result of the last line (the print statement from above) will
        look as follows:

            kind: processing
            type: Normalisation
            properties:

                kind: maximum
                range: null
                range_unit: index
                noise_range: null

            apply_to: []
            result: ''

        particular task. Not all of them are strictly necessary, and for
        details, you still need to look into the respective documentation.
        But this can make it much easier to add tasks to a recipe.

        Similarly, you can get YAML representations of an empty recipe where
        you can add to your tasks to. For details, see the documentation of the
        :meth:`Recipe.to_yaml` method.

class ProcessingTask(Task):
    """
    Processing step defined as task in recipe-driven data analysis.

    Processing steps will always be performed individually for each dataset.

    For more information on the underlying general class,
    see :class:`aspecd.processing.SingleProcessingStep`.

    For an example of how such a processing task may be included into a
    recipe, see the YAML listing below:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep
        properties:
          parameters:
            param1: bar

          comment: >
            Some free text describing in more details the processing step
        apply_to:
          - loi:xxx

    Note that you can refer to datasets and results created during cooking
    of a recipe using their respective labels. Those labels will
    automatically be replaced by the actual dataset/result prior to
    performing the task.

    Sometimes it can come in quite handy to compare different processing
    steps on the same original dataset, *e.g.* a series of different
    parameters. Think of a polynomial baseline correction where you would
    like to compare the effect of polynomials of different order. Here,
    what you are interested in is to work on *copies* of the original
    dataset and get the results stored additionally. Here you go:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep
        result: label


    And if you now want to do that for multiple datasets, you can do that as
    well. However, make sure to provide as many result labels as you have
    datasets to perform the processing step on, as otherwise no result will
    be stored and the processing step will operate on the original datasets:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep
        apply_to:
          - loi:xxx
          - loi:yyy
        result:
          - label1
          - label2


    Another thing that can be very useful for data processing is to add a
    comment to an individual step, *e.g.* with an explanation why this step
    has been performed:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: processing
        type: SingleProcessingStep
        comment: >
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
          consectetur adipiscing elit.


    Note that using the ``>`` sign will replace newline characters with
    spaces. If you want to preserve the newline characters, use ``|`` instead.


    Attributes
    ----------
    result : :class:`str`
        Label for the results of a processing step.

        Processing steps always operate on datasets. However, sometimes it
        is useful to have a processing task return a copy of the processed
        dataset, in order to compare different processings afterwards.
        Therefore, you can specify a ``result`` label. In this case,
        the dataset will be copied first, the processing step performed on
        it, and afterwards the result returned as a *new* dataset that is
        accessible throughout the rest of the recipe with the label provided.

        In case you perform the processing on several datasets, you may want
        to provide as many result labels as there are datasets. Otherwise,
        no result will be assigned.

    parameters. Here, what you are interested in is to work on *copies* of
    the original dataset and get the results stored additionally. Here you go:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: multiprocessing
        type: MultiProcessingStep
        apply_to:
          - loi:xxx
          - loi:yyy
        result:
          - label1
          - label2


    Attributes
    ----------
    result : :class:`list`
        Labels for the results of a processing step.

        Processing steps always operate on datasets. However, sometimes it
        is useful to have a processing task return a copy of the processed
        dataset, in order to compare different processings afterwards.
        Therefore, you can specify a ``result`` label. In this case,
        the dataset will be copied first, the processing step performed on
        it, and afterwards the result returned as a *new* dataset that is
        accessible throughout the rest of the recipe with the label provided.

        In case you perform the processing on several datasets, you may want
        to provide as many result labels as there are datasets. Otherwise,
        no result will be assigned.

    Note that you can refer to datasets and results created during cooking
    of a recipe using their respective labels. Those labels will
    automatically be replaced by the actual dataset/result prior to
    performing the task.

    And if you now want to do that for multiple datasets, you can do that as
    well. However, make sure to provide as many result labels as you have
    datasets to perform the analysis step on, as otherwise no result will
    be stored:

    In case you perform the analysis on several datasets, you may want to
    provide as many result labels as there are datasets. Otherwise,
    no result will be assigned.


    Another thing that can be very useful for data analysis is to add a

    has been performed:

    Note that you can refer to datasets and results created during cooking
    of a recipe using their respective labels. Those labels will
    automatically be replaced by the actual dataset/result prior to
    performing the task.

    .. note::
        As soon as you provide a filename in the properties of your recipe,
        the resulting plot will automatically be saved to that filename,
        inferring the file format from the extension of the filename. For
        details of how the format is inferred see the documentation for the
        :meth:`matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig` method.

    In case you apply the single plotter to more than one dataset and would
    like to save individual plots, you can do that by supplying a list of
    filenames instead of only a single filename. In this case, the plots get
    saved to the filenames in the list. A minimal example may look like this:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: singleplot
        type: SinglePlotter
        properties:
          filename:

            - fancyfigure2.pdf
        apply_to:
          - loi:xxx
          - loi:yyy

    .. important::
        Make sure to provide the same number of file names in your recipe as
        the number of datasets you apply the plotter to. Otherwise you may
        run into trouble.

    .. note::
        If the recipe contains the ``output`` key in its ``directories`` dict,
        the figure(s) will be saved to this directory.

    As long as ``autosave_plots`` in the recipe is set to True, the plots
    will be saved automatically, even if no filename is provided. These
    automatically generated filenames consist of the last part of the
    dataset source (excluding a potential file extension) and the name of
    the plotter used. To prevent the plotters in a recipe from automatically
    saving the plots, include the ``autosave_plots`` directive in the
    ``settings`` dict of your recipe and set it to False.

class CompositeplotTask(PlotTask):
    """
    Compositeplot step defined as task in recipe-driven data analysis.

    Compositeplot steps are performed on a list of plots and combine them in
    one single figure. For more common plots employing only a single axes,
    see :class:`aspecd.tasks.SingleplotTask` and
    :class:`aspecd.tasks.MultiplotTask`.

    For more information on the underlying general class,
    see :class:`aspecd.plotting.CompositePlotter`.

    For an example of how such a compositeplot task may be included into a
    recipe, see the YAML listing below:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - kind: singleplot
          type: SinglePlotter1D
          apply_to:
            - dataset1
          result: 1D_plot

        - kind: singleplot
          type: SinglePlotter2D
          apply_to:
            - dataset2
          result: 2D_plot

        - kind: compositeplot
          type: CompositePlotter
          properties:
            grid_dimensions: [1, 2]
            subplot_locations:
              - [0, 0, 1, 1]
              - [0, 1, 1, 1]
            plotter:
              - 1D_plot
              - 2D_plot
            filename: composed_plot.pdf

    The crucial aspect here is to first define the individual plotters that
    get used for the respective panels of the CompositePlotter. In this
    particular example, two different plots on two different datasets are
    created and afterwards combined into the CompositePlotter. Furthermore,
    for a CompositePlot you need to specify both, grid dimensions and
    subplot locations, as they will be set to one single axis by default.

    The example above would create a plot with **one row and two columns**
    (*i.e.*, two axes side-by-side). The grid dimensions are given as
    "[number of rows, number of columns]", and each subplot location is a list
    with four integer values: "[start_row, start_column, row_span,
    column_span]". Therefore, having the same plot, but with the axes
    appearing in **one column and two rows** (*i.e.*, stacked on top of each
    other), you would define the CompositePlotter step as follows:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - kind: compositeplot
          type: CompositePlotter
          properties:
            grid_dimensions: [2, 1]
            subplot_locations:
              - [0, 0, 1, 1]
              - [1, 0, 1, 1]
            plotter:
              - 1D_plot
              - 2D_plot
            filename: composed_plot.pdf

    Of course, you can create arbitrarily complex arrangements of axes
    within a figure, even with one axis spanning several rows or columns.
    Note that the size you set to the figure of the composite plotter
    defines the aspect ratio and relative size of the individual axes.
    As an example, in a two-row layout with two axes stacked on top of each
    other, you may want to have an overall quadratic figure with size 6x6 inch
    to fit decently to a normal page:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - kind: compositeplot
          type: CompositePlotter
          properties:
            grid_dimensions: [2, 1]
            subplot_locations:
              - [0, 0, 1, 1]
              - [1, 0, 1, 1]
            plotter:
              - 1D_plot
              - 2D_plot
            properties:
              figure:
                size: [6.0, 6.0]
            filename: composed_plot.pdf

    As with all the other plotters, there are many more options to control
    the appearance of your figures.

    .. note::
        As long as the ``autosave_plots`` in the recipe is set to True,
        the results of the individual plotters combined in the
        CompositePlotter will be saved to generic filenames. To prevent this
        from happening, include the ``autosave_plots`` directive in the
        ``settings`` dict of your recipe and set it to False.

class ReportTask(Task):
    """
    Reporting step defined as task in recipe-driven data analysis.

    For more information on the underlying general class,
    see :class:`aspecd.report.Reporter`.

    For an example of how such a report task may be included into a recipe,
    see the YAML listing below:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - kind: report
          type: LaTeXReporter
          properties:
            template: dataset.tex
            filename: report.tex
          compile: true

    In this particular case, we use a LaTeX reporter and most likely one of
    the templates that come bundled with the ASpecD package (atl least,
    a template with that name comes bundled with ASpecD). As the template
    name already suggests, this report will contain information on a
    dataset. Furthermore, setting ``compile`` to true will render the
    generated report into a PDF document.

    Note that you can refer to datasets, results, and figures created during
    cooking of a recipe using their respective labels. Those labels will
    automatically be replaced by the actual dataset/result prior to
    performing the task.

    Whatever fields you set in the property ``context`` can be accessed
    directly from within the template using the usual Python syntax for
    accessing keys of dictionaries as well as the (more convenient) dot
    syntax provided by Jinja2.

    Additionally, the context will contain the key ``dataset`` containing the
    result of the :meth:`aspecd.dataset.Dataset.to_dict` method, thus the full
    information contained in the dataset.

    You can, of course, apply the report task to multiple datasets
    individually. In this case, you most probably would like to have your
    reports saved to individual files. This means that the property
    ``filename`` needs to become a list:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        datasets:
          - foo
          - bar

        tasks:
          - kind: report
            type: LaTeXReporter
            properties:
              template: my-fancy-latex-template.tex
              filename:
                - report1.tex
                - report2.tex


    .. important::
        Make sure to provide the same number of file names in your recipe as
        the number of datasets you apply the report to. Otherwise you may
        run into trouble.

    .. note::
        If the recipe contains the ``output`` key in its ``directories`` dict,
        the report(s) will be saved to this directory.

    In case you do not provide a filename, the report is nevertheless saved
    for each of the datasets, using an auto-generated filename consisting of
    the dataset label and the template used. Assuming a dataset "foo" and a
    template "dataset.tex", the resulting report will be saved to the file
    "foo_report_dataset.tex".

    Generally, you are entirely free to create content for your reports from
    within a recipe, as the following fictitious example shows:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kind: report
        type: LaTeXReporter
        properties:
          template: my-fancy-latex-template.tex
          filename: some-filename-for-final-report.tex
          context:
            general:
              title: Some fancy title
              author: John Doe
            free_text:

                Short introduction of the experiment performed
              metadata: >

              history: >

                steps

              title: my_fancy_figure
        compile: True
        apply_to:
          - loi:xxx

    The fields shown here assume a certain structure of your template
    containing user-supplied free text for the introduction to several
    sections. And be aware that in such cases, you need to know your
    templates quite well and have a direct dependency between the keys
    provided in the recipe and the corresponding placeholders in your
    template. Therefore, much more often, you will use either general
    reporters for datasets and alike (as shown above) or create specialised
    reporter classes collecting the necessary information for you.

class FigurereportTask(Task):
    r"""
    Reporting step particularly for figure captions.

    While the more generic :class:`ReportTask` operates on datasets,
    this task operates on figure records stored within a recipe's
    :attr:`Recipe.figures` attribute and is hence dedicated to creating
    figure captions. This is pretty useful in case you have added captions
    to your figures within a recipe and want to automatically include the
    final figure and caption into a document.

    Think of a report or thesis written in LaTeX: With a series of recipes
    analysing your data and creating the figures, wouldn't it be charming to
    have the figure captions automatically created as well from within the
    recipe, as there you probably know the best how to describe your data?
    That's what this task is good for. Including the figure and caption in
    this case reduces to a mere ``\input`` statement in LaTeX.

    As reporters, you can use all the reporter classes provided with the
    ASpecD framework. For more information see the :mod:`aspecd.report` module.

    For an example of how such a report task may be included into a recipe,
    see the YAML listing below:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - kind: singleplot
          type: SinglePlotter1D
          label: overview1D

        - kind: figurereport
          type: LaTeXReporter
          properties:
            template: figure.tex
            filename: fig_caption.tex
          apply_to: overview1D

    In this particular case, we use a LaTeX reporter and most likely one of
    the templates that come bundled with the ASpecD package (atl least,
    a template with that name comes bundled with ASpecD).

    You can, of course, apply the report task to multiple figures
    individually. In this case, you most probably would like to have your
    reports saved to individual files. This means that the property
    ``filename`` needs to become a list:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - kind: singleplot
          type: SinglePlotter1D
          label: overview1D
        - kind: singleplot
          type: SinglePLotter1D
          label: overview2
        - kind: report
          type: LaTeXReporter
          properties:
            template: figure.tex
            filename:
              - fig1_caption.tex
              - fig2_caption.tex
          apply_to:
            - overview1D
            - overview2


    .. important::
        Make sure to provide the same number of file names in your recipe as
        the number of figures you apply the report to. Otherwise you may
        run into trouble.

    .. note::
        If the recipe contains the ``output`` key in its ``directories`` dict,
        the report(s) will be saved to this directory.

    In case you do not provide a filename, the report is nevertheless saved
    for each of the figures, using an auto-generated filename consisting of
    the figure label and the template used. Assuming a figure "fig1" and a
    template "figure.tex", the resulting report will be saved to the file
    "fig1_report_figure.tex".

    Building a model defined as task in recipe-driven data analysis.

    Note that you can refer to datasets and results created during cooking
    of a recipe using their respective labels. Those labels will
    automatically be replaced by the actual dataset/result prior to
    performing the task.

    Here, we have used this for the parameter ``from_dataset`` in the above
    recipe excerpt. For an :obj:`aspecd.model.Model` object, you can set the
    variables explicitly. However, in context of a recipe, this is rarely
    useful. Therefore, the ``from_dataset`` parameter lets you refer to a
    dataset (by its label used within the recipe) that is used to call the
    :meth:`aspecd.model.Model.from_dataset` method with to obtain the
    variables from this dataset.

    Attributes
    ----------
    result : :class:`str`
        Label for the dataset resulting from the model creation

        The result will always be an :obj:`aspecd.dataset.CalculatedDataset`
        object.

        This label will be used to refer to the result later on when
        further processing the recipe.

    from_dataset : :class:`str`
        Label of a dataset to obtain variables from

        The label needs to be a valid label to a dataset within the given
        recipe. The underlying dataset is obtained from the recipe and used
        to call the :meth:`aspecd.model.Model.from_dataset` method with to
        obtain the variables from this dataset.

    output : :class:`str`
        Type of output returned in ``result`` if given

        Can be "dataset" (default) or "model". The latter is important in
        case the model as such needs to be accessed, *e.g.* in context of

class ChefDeService:
    """
    Wrapper for serving the results of recipes given a recipe file name.

    In recipe-driven data analysis, a recipe of class
    :class:`aspecd.tasks.Recipe` get cooked by a chef of class
    :class:`aspecd.tasks.Chef`. However, this requires to get the
    appropriate dataset factory of class
    :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` or a class inheriting from this one,
    depending on the package actually used.

    However, the (end) user would rather like to not care about those
    details and simply provide a recipe filename (of a YAML file) to an
    instance of a class and get the results back. This is where the
    ``ChefDeService`` comes in.

    Obtaining the results of a recipe will become as simple as::

        chef_de_service = ChefDeService()
        chef_de_service.serve(recipe_filename='my_recipe.yaml')

    Furthermore, the ``ChefDeService`` takes care of persisting the history
    of the cooked recipe in form of a YAML file. Therefore, an additional
    file gets created consisting of the filename of the recipe provided,
    extended by the timestamp of serving the results. These history files
    can be used as recipe again, allowing for full turnover.


    Attributes
    ----------
    recipe_filename : :class:`str`
        Name of the recipe file to serve the cooked results for

    Raises
    ------
    aspecd.tasks.MissingRecipeError

def serve():

    Serve the results of cooking a recipe

    All you need to do is to provide the filename of a recipe YAML file.

    The ASpecD framework creates a console script entry point named "serve"
    that will allow you to even type ``serve <recipe_name.yaml>`` on the
    command line after installing the ASpecD framework.

    Thanks to the modular nature of the ASpecD framework, if your recipe
    contains the ``default_package`` key followed by the name of a package
    based on the ASpecD framework, the correct instance of the
    :class:`aspecd.dataset.DatasetFactory` class will be created
    and added to the recipe automatically, thus allowing you to serve
    recipes that rely on functionality of ASpecD-derived packages for their
    being cooked and served.
