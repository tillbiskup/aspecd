=======
Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* Metadata mapper via yaml file

* Documentation: Use cases

* Plotter: Handle multiple axes (cwepr:GoniometerPlotter)


For later versions
==================

* Templates for creating derived packages

* Default report templates for each type of processing/analysis task


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
