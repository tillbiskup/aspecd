ASpecD documentation
====================

Welcome! This is the documentation for ASpecD. For general information see its `Homepage <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_.

ASpecD is a **framework** for handling **spectroscopic data** focussing on **reproducibility**. In short: Each and every processing step applied to your data will be recorded and can be traced back. Additionally, for each representation of your data (*e.g.*, figures, tables) you can easily follow how the data shown have been processed and where they originate from.


Features
--------

A list of features, not all implemented yet but aimed at for the first public release (ASpecD 0.1):

* Framework for writing applications handling spectroscopic data

* Consistent handling of numeric data and corresponding metadata

* History of each processing step, automatically generated, aiming at full reproducibility

* Undo and redo of processing steps

* Import and export of data

* Generic plotting capabilities, easily extendable

* Report generation using pre-defined templates

* Recipe-driven data analysis, allowing tasks to be performed fully unattended in the background


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.5)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation


.. warning::
  The ASpecD framework is currently under active development and still considered in Alpha development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.


Where to start
--------------

Users new to ASpecD should probably start :doc:`at the beginning <audience>`, those familiar with its :doc:`underlying concepts <concepts>` may jump straight to the section explaining how to :doc:`write applications based on the ASpecD framework <applications>`.

The :doc:`API documentation <api/index>` is the definite source of information for developers, besides having a look at the source code.

A note on the logo
------------------

The snake (obviously a python, look at how it's holding the magnifying glass) is well familiar with the scientific method and illustrates the basic idea of the ASpecD framework: reproducible data analysis. The copyright of the logo belongs to J. Popp.
