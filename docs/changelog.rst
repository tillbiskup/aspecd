This page contains a summary of changes between the official ASpecD releases. Only the biggest changes are listed here. A complete and detailed log of all changes is available through the `GitHub Repository Browser <https://github.com/tillbiskup/aspecd/commits/master>`_.


Version 0.2.0
=============

Not yet released


New features
------------

* DatasetAlgebra: add and subtract data of second dataset to/from dataset

* ExtractCommonRange for 1D and 2D datasets

* SinglePlotter2D:

  * Filled contour plot with additional contour lines that can be styled

  * Lines of contour plot can be styled

* SliceExtraction now handles both, axis indices and axis values


Changes
-------

* SliceExtraction: parameter "index" renamed to "position"

* ProcessingStep split into SingleProcessingStep and MultiProcessingStep

  All processing steps previously inheriting from aspecd.ProcessingStep need to inherit now from aspecd.SingleProcessingStep to continue working as expected.


New dependencies
----------------

* scipy (for interpolation in ExtractCommonRange)

The following bugs have been fixed:

* MetadataMapper: Fix sequence of mapping operations performed

* CompositePlotter: Legends for subplots work

* SliceExtraction: Remove correct axis from dataset

* MultiPlotter1D*: Fix problem in conjunction with CompositePlotter and assigning drawings

* SliceExtraction: fix problem extracting slice with index zero

* CompositePlotter: more intuitive axes_positions
