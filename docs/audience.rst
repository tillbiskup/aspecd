Who is the target audience of the ASpecD framework? Is it interesting for me?


Spectroscopists aiming at reproducibility
=========================================

The ASpecD framework addresses every scientist working with data (both, measured and calculated) on a daily base. As ASpecD is developed by an (experimental) spectroscopist, the focus is mainly on spectroscopy for the time being, although the underlying concepts should be sufficiently general to be useful in other context as well.


Motivation and general ideas
============================

The motivation and general idea behind the ASpecD framework is to ensure reproducibility and---as much as possible---replicability of data processing, starting from recording data and ending with their final (graphical) representation, e.g., in a peer-reviewed publication. This is done by mostly automatically creating a gap-less record of each processing step.

Every scientist should be well familiar with the concept of reproducibility and its importance for science in general. Nevetheless, those not taking care of these aspects will probably have hard time with the ASpecD framework and with some of its aspects, particulary those regaring their personal freedom of doing things their way.
