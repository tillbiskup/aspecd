ASpecD
======

``aspecd`` is a framework for handling spectroscopic data focussing on reproducicibility. In short: Each and every processing step applied to your data will be recorded and can be traced back, and additionally, for each representation of your data (e.g., figures, tables) you can easily follow how the data shown have been processed and where they originate from.
